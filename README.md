## My Process
For this project, I followed a mobile-first approach to implement responsive design. I started by designing and styling the components for mobile screens and then utilized media queries for screens above 600px to enhance the layout for larger devices. Additionally, I leveraged CSS custom variables for defining colors and utilized transparency with HSLA() to achieve various design variations while maintaining consistency. The task also involved dynamically populating data onto the webpage based on JSON input. I started by structuring the HTML content and styling it using CSS. Then, I implemented JavaScript functionality to fetch data from the JSON file and dynamically populate the result and summary sections of the webpage. Throughout the process, I focused on maintaining clean and organized code to ensure readability and maintainability.


### Built With
- HTML: Used for structuring the webpage content.
- CSS: Implemented styling to enhance the visual appearance of the components.
- JavaScript: Utilized for fetching data, dynamic data population, and DOM manipulation.

### What I Learned
- Implemented responsive design using a mobile-first approach, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Utilized media queries to adjust the layout for screens above 600px, enhancing the component's usability on larger screens.
- Learned to use CSS custom variables for defining colors and applied transparency with HSLA() to achieve design variations.
- Enhanced my skills in dynamic data population using JavaScript, particularly handling JSON data.
- Improved understanding of asynchronous programming and promises in JavaScript.
- Practiced efficient DOM manipulation techniques to update the webpage content dynamically.

### Continued Development
Moving forward, I plan to refactor the codebase for better performance and maintainability. I also intend to focus on accessibility and responsiveness to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
